// Some notes on git:


     How to initialize a Git Repository:
     
          1. Change your directory so you're inside the one you want
          to post to GitHub.
          
          2. Use (git init) to initialize the repository.
          
          3. Type in (git status) to see what Git sees when your new 
          repository is initialized. 
          
          4. Type in (git add . (the . means your current directory))
          to tell Git to track any changes you make the the files. 
          
          5. Now that Git is tracking them, you can commit them to 
          store this specific snapshot of your project. In this case,
          you'd use (git commit -m "Initial commit").
          
          6. Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Make sure to
          give it a name and description.
          
          7. Because you have an existing repository, add the GitHub
          repository as a "remote" to your local Git repository. In 
          this case, you'd use (git remote add origin ADDRESS). A
          "remote" is a copy of your local repository which will be 
          held in the GitHub's servers. In this case, the remote is
          called origin. 
          
          8. To send changes to the remote repository, use (git push
          origin master). 
          
          9. To check to see if your code matches up with the code on
          GitHub - or is up to date, basically - type in (git pull
          origin master).
          
          10. Use (vi .gitignore) to exclude certain files. To insert,
          press i. Then write what you want to exclude, separated by
          line breaks. When done, press esc, then write (:wq) to quit.


     You should be able to:
     
          - Create (initialize) a new Git repository
          
          - Save (add and commit) files to a repository.
          
          - Create a repository on GitHub for your project.
          
          - Push your commits to the GitHub repository.
          
          - Recover lost work from GitHub.
